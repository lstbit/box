# cutebrain fonts

- `private-build-plans.toml` contains custom build plans for making iosevka.

## Fonts
- cutebrain sans (Quasi-proportional Sans-Serif)
- cutebrain mono (monospace variant w/ ligatures)
- cutebrain term (monospace variant for use with terminals)

## Notes
We build the fonts with a width of 600 so use even pt sizes in your applicaiton configurations.


Instead of 400 being the weight for Regular/Normal we've set this to 500 to make it feel a
little bolder.

## Dependencies

- Iosevka Source Directory
- NodeJS@20
- TTFautohint
