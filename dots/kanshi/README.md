# Kanshi Config


Configs are host dependent due to laptops having differing builtin displays.

These are not managed by linkr due to the install script needing to be a little more intelligent.

Currently supports:
- Thinkbook 13x Gen 4

We provide a systemd unit for automatic activation upon login. Install as a user service in 
`~/.config/systemd/user`
